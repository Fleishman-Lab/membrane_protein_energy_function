# membrane_protein_energy_function

this repo contains the files required to create and calibrate the ref2015_memb membrane protein energy function.
it has two main parts:
 - MPResdiueLipophilicity calibration
 - PDBTM analysis and MPSpanAngle calibration

paths to Rosetta and other files require changing.
